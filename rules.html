      <h1>Ultimate Frisbee</h1>
      <p>Ultimate is a non-contact, self-officiated team sport played with a flying disc. Two teams of seven compete on a field similar in length to a football field but narrower, with end zones at each end. Teams score by catching the disc in the opponent’s end zone. The player with the disc (the thrower) cannot run and must pass it in any direction. If the disc is dropped or intercepted, possession changes. The defending team becomes the offense and attempts to score in the opposite end zone.</p>
